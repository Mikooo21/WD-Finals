           <h2>Practice Website</h2>
           <p>This is the first time I have tried to code my very own website and it turned out to be really bad now that I am actually experiencing creating a website with proper rulesets and others.</p>

               <p>A little bit of knowledge gained thanks to our proffesor and a little bit of watching Youtube I have managed to create a landing page that links up to the resume.</p>

                    <p>With only 3 hours our block section tried our best to replicate a website that was given to us in order to see how much we have improved. Thankfully I passed the exam.</p>

                    <p>This is where we learned how to create headers and footers design for a website. Although I didnt manage to finish my footers on time and was only able to make the headers.</p>

                <p>As the name suggest it features or highlights what the website has to offer. It can be a model of a car, a gaming console even household appliance.</p>
